This is basically just a repository of all of my leet code submisisons.

I dont have the prompts specifically, just a halfway descriptive file name for each.

Here for my own archival purposes but all should be correct, so feel free to look at them.

Anything with an "A" at the beginning are scripts I have done a couple different ways and finally settled on one algorithm. 

This is simply an effort to keep work im more proud of at the top of the repo.
